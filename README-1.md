## Multiple Owners

You can allow multiple Discord accounts to use the bot by adding their user IDs to `OWNER_IDS`:

```python
OWNER_IDS = {
    901487880067776524,   # main account
    123456789012345678,   # friend's account
    987654321098765432,   # another account
}
```

## Lavalink

The bot comes pre-configured with a public Lavalink node. If it goes down, you can self-host one or replace it in the config:

```python
LAVALINK_HOST = "your.lavalink.host"
LAVALINK_PORT = 2333
LAVALINK_PASS = "youshallnotpass"
LAVALINK_SECURE = False  # True if using HTTPS/WSS
```
